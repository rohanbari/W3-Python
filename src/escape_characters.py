# What happens when a string is defined like: "Hello, I live in "Kolkata""?
# We might understand it, but not the Python interpreter.

# Comment out to see the error.
# sample_str = "The Santa Claus lives in "North Pole""

# The correct approach is:
sample_str = "The Santa Claus lives in \"North Pole\""
print(sample_str)
