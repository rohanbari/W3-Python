# How would we solve mathematical expressions in programming? Well, that is why
# operators exist. Let's have a look at them.
 
str = """Python supports these operators:
  op1 [] op2, [] can be +, -, *, /, %, ** (to the power), // (floor div.)
Like any other programming language, it supports assignment operators, too.
  op [] val, [] can be =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=
Comparison operators are the exact same as in any other language.
  op1 [] op2, [] can be ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
Logical operators are no exception.
  op1 [] op2, [] can be and, or, not, (is, is not -- only for objects)
Membership operators:
  obj1 [] obj2, [] can be in, not in
Bitwise operators are used to compare binary numbers:
  op1 [] op2, [] can be &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>""";
